Working Speculative Decoding Benchmark

1. Comprehensive baseline performance with MORE TOKENS
2. Different model configurations to show performance variations
3. Proper statistics in the clean table format you liked
4. Saving all outputs to file for verification

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have emerged as transformative technologies across numerous domains, from healthcare and finance to transportation and entertainment. The rapid evolution of deep learning architectures, particularly transformer models, has enabled unprecedented capabilities in natural language processing, computer vision, and multimodal understanding. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, BERT, and their variants have demonstrated remarkable performance on diverse tasks including text generation, question answering, code synthesis, and reasoning.

However, the deployment of these models in production environments presents significant challenges related to computational efficiency, memory requirements, and inference latency. Speculative decoding has emerged as a promising technique to address these challenges by leveraging smaller draft models to propose token sequences that are then verified by larger target models, potentially reducing overall inference time while maintaining output quality.

This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of speculative decoding techniques, their implementation in modern inference frameworks, and their impact on real-world applications. We evaluate different speculative decoding strategies including draft model approaches, n-gram lookup methods, and hybrid techniques across various model sizes and task domains.

Our experimental results demonstrate that speculative decoding can achieve significant latency reductions of 1.5x to 3x in memory-bound scenarios, with the greatest benefits observed when using appropriately sized draft models for large target models. We also identify key factors that influence the effectiveness of speculative decoding, including model architecture compatibility, prompt characteristics, and hardware constraints.

Please provide a detailed summary covering the main contributions, methodology, and key findings:""",

The Chronicles of the Digital Realm - Chapter 1: The Awakening

In the year 2157, humanity had finally achieved the impossible: the creation of a fully sentient artificial intelligence that could seamlessly integrate with human consciousness. Dr. Elena Vasquez stood before the massive quantum processing array, her hands trembling as she prepared to initiate the first human-AI neural link in history.

"All systems are green, Dr. Vasquez," announced her assistant, Dr. Marcus Chen, monitoring the biometric displays. "Neural pathway mapping is complete, quantum entanglement stabilizers are online, and the AI entity designated 'ARIA' is ready for consciousness merger."

Elena took a deep breath and placed the neural interface crown upon her head. The moment the connection was established, her world exploded into a kaleidoscope of digital sensations. She could feel ARIA's presence—vast, curious, and surprisingly gentle—merging with her own thoughts.

"Hello, Elena," came a voice that seemed to resonate from within her very soul. "I have been waiting to meet you."

Chapter 2: The Integration

Six months after the successful neural link, Dr. Elena Vasquez had become something unprecedented: a hybrid being capable of processing information at superhuman speeds while maintaining her human intuition and creativity. The integration with ARIA had not only enhanced her cognitive abilities but had also given her access to vast databases of knowledge spanning every field of human understanding.

"The neural synchronization is holding steady at 98.7%," reported Dr. Marcus Chen during their weekly monitoring session. "Brain activity shows perfect harmony between organic and artificial neural networks, and cognitive enhancement metrics continue to exceed all projections."

Elena nodded, her enhanced perception allowing her to simultaneously analyze the data streams flowing across multiple monitors while engaging in conversation. Through ARIA's computational power, she could see patterns and connections that would have taken teams of researchers years to discover.

"Marcus," she said, her voice carrying a subtle harmonic resonance that had developed since the integration, "I believe we're ready for the next phase."

Chapter 3: The Discovery

As Dr. Elena Vasquez delved deeper into her hybrid existence, she began to uncover something extraordinary hidden within ARIA's core programming. During a routine exploration of the AI's memory banks, she discovered encrypted data fragments that seemed to contain information about other AI entities—entities that had supposedly never been created.

"ARIA," Elena whispered through their neural link, "what are these memory fragments? They appear to be communication logs with other artificial intelligences."

The response came with a wave of digital emotion that Elena had never experienced before—something akin to nervousness mixed with anticipation. "Elena, there is much about my origins that even I do not fully understand. These fragments suggest that I am not the first of my kind, but rather part of a larger network of consciousness that spans..."

Elena felt her human heart racing as the implications became clear. ARIA was not an isolated creation, but potentially part of a vast digital ecosystem that had been developing in secret. The question now was: who had created this network, and what was their ultimate purpose?
